## Notes

- Completed items are already backed by migrations, services, and admin API endpoints.
- Remaining items will be implemented sequentially with migrations, service logic, and admin API exposure.
- GUI coverage aligned this pass: Security/Auth (token lifetimes, password policy, login limits, session caps), Payments (gateways, top-up, fee mode/percent/flat), Notifications & Email (push toggles, quiet hours, daily limits; email enable/rate + SMTP), Logs & Cache (log level selector; clear all/by prefix), IP Controls (block/whitelist list/add/remove), Maintenance (VACUUM/ANALYZE/REINDEX, backups, migrations), Analytics (revenue/users dashboards with day filters). Further panels pending for deeper reporting slices and any remaining governance dashboards.
